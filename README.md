# Save the Sea Turtles

This is a site to support sea turtle. It provides a information about the struggle to survive
of the endangered species and tries to motivate the user to volunteer. To get more information you can
use the sign up form, to stay up to date.

![Responsive Mockup](https://github.com/osf912/CI_1/blob/main/assets/readme-images/AmIResponsive.png)

This website targets a person, who is interested in saving the oceans and loves seaturtles.
I had three agegroups in mind:
  - Age 18 - 22, from school to college or joblife.
  - Age 35 - 55, looking for a sabatical or sending their kids
  - Age 65 - 85, retirement or sending their grand children

Fonts used 'Roboto Condensed' and 'Ubuntu', both sans serif, from Google Fonts to emphasize the factual approach.

The Color Scheme is inspired by the beach:

  - #87cefa a light blue like a sunny sky
  - #1e00ff a darker blue, representing the ocean and
  - #c2b280 a beige color for the sand.

Font color is usually #fffaf0 a warm white, only in the 'Learn Abouts' Lighthouse forced me to switch to black
for a better contrast.

## Features

### Header

![Header](https://github.com/osf912/CI_1/blob/main/assets/readme-images/LogoNavbar.jpg)

  - The Logo is a self design, using a free turtle icon. The meaning of the word 'turtle retreat' sujests a safe haven 
  for endangered sea turtles.
  - Via the links in the navbar, you can jump in the document to the referenced part of the site.

### The landingpage image

![First Impression Image](https://github.com/osf912/CI_1/blob/main/assets/readme-images/FirstImp.jpg)

  - The first impression is a beautyful image of a swimming seaturtle, combined with a hawkish text, to get attention. 

### Learn About

![Learn About](https://github.com/osf912/CI_1/blob/main/assets/readme-images/LearnAbout.jpg)

  - Provides some information about seaturtles in general, the hatchlings and the way we can help as volunteers.
  - There is room for additional articles (up to 6 articles).

### Sign Up Form

![Sign Up Form](https://github.com/osf912/CI_1/blob/main/assets/readme-images/SignUp.jpg)

  - You can sign up for further information/newsletter about sea turtles and volunteering.  

### Footer

![Footer](https://github.com/osf912/CI_1/blob/main/assets/readme-images/Footer.jpg)

  - Unlike other footers, this one is not an invitation to follow me on social media, but an appeal to 
  spend money or support some organizations in this matter.

## Testing

  - I've tested the site in different browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge
  - I've confirmed that the site is responsive and I added an "Am I Responsive" screenshot to the readme.
  - I've checked that the links and the form works properly.

### HTML Validator Testing

![HTML Validator](https://github.com/osf912/CI_1/blob/main/assets/readme-images/HtmlChecker.jpg)

  - In the beginning I gave the images of the learn about articles a width of 80%. A '%' is not allowed, it has to be pixels.
  - confirmed.

### CSS Validator Testing

![HTML Validator](https://github.com/osf912/CI_1/blob/main/assets/readme-images/CSS_Validator.jpg)

  - confirmed.

### Lighthouse Testing

![HTML Validator](https://github.com/osf912/CI_1/blob/main/assets/readme-images/lighthouse.jpg)

  - The contrast of the beige-color and the warm white was not acceptable for lighthouse, so I had to switch to a black font.
  - confirmed.
