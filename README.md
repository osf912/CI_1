# Save the Sea Turtles

This is a site to support the sea turtles. It gives a few informations about the struggle to survive
of the endangered species and try to motivate the user to volunteer. To get more information you can
use the sign up form, to stay informed.

![Responsive Mockup](https://github.com/osf912/CI_1/tree/main/assets/readme-images/AmIResponsive.jpg)

This website is targeted to a person, who is interested in help saving the oceans and love the seaturtles.
I had three ages in mind:
  - Age 18 - 22, from school to college or joblife.
  - Age 35 - 55, looking for a sabatical or sending their kids
  - Age 65 - 85, retirement or sending their grand children

Font are Roboto Condensed and Ubuntu, both sans serif, from Google Fonts to underline the information approach.

The Color Scheme is inspired by the beach:

  - #87cefa a light blue like a sunny sky
  - #1e00ff a darker blue, representing the ocean and
  - #c2b280 a sand tone for the beach.

Font color is usually #fffaf0 a warm white, just in the Learn Abouts Lighthouse forced me to switch to black
because of a better contrast.

## Features

I will describe the main parts of the site in the following.

### Header

![Header](https://github.com/osf912/CI_1/tree/main/assets/readme-images/LogoNavbar.jpg)

  - The Logo is a self design, using a free turle icon and the text 'turtle retreat' as a safe haven for endangered sea turtles.
  - With the links in the navbar, you can jump in the document to the referenced part of the site.

### The landingpage image

![First Impression Image](https://github.com/osf912/CI_1/tree/main/assets/readme-images/FirstImp.jpg)

  - The first impression is a beautyful image of a swimming seaturtle, combined with a hawkish text, to show who's the problem. 

### Learn About

![Learn About](https://github.com/osf912/CI_1/tree/main/assets/readme-images/LearnAbout.jpg)

  - Provide some information about seaturtles in general, the hatchlings and ways we can help as volunteers.
  - This part can be completed with additional articles (to maybe six or nine articles)

### Sign Up Form

![Sign Up Form](https://github.com/osf912/CI_1/tree/main/assets/readme-images/SignUp.jpg)

  - Here you can sign up for further information about seaturtles and volunteering. 
  - A future form could some additional possibilities to checkbox if you like to volunteer and a select-element on which continent. Or maybe a select-element for which species you want to volunteer. 

### Footer

![Footer](https://github.com/osf912/CI_1/tree/main/assets/readme-images/Footer.jpg)

  - The footer in this case is not an invitation to follow me on social media, but an appeal to spend money or support
  some organizations in this matter.

## Testing

  - I've tested the site in different browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge
  - I've confirmed that the site is responsive and add an "Am I Responsive" screenshot to the readme.
  - I've checked that the links and the form works properly.

### HTML Validator Testing

![HTML Validator](https://github.com/osf912/CI_1/tree/main/assets/readme-images/HtmlChecker.jpg)

  - In the beginning I gave the images of the learn about articles a width of 80%. A % is not allowed it has to be pixels.
  - confirmed.

### CSS Validator Testing

![HTML Validator](https://github.com/osf912/CI_1/tree/main/assets/readme-images/CSS_Validator.jpg)

  - confirmed.

### Lighthouse Testing

![HTML Validator](https://github.com/osf912/CI_1/tree/main/assets/readme-images/lighthouse.jpg)

  - The contrast of the sand tone and the warm white was not acceptable for lighthouse, so I had to switch to a black font.
  - confirmed.
