            <h2>Sea Turtles are great</h2>
            <p>
                Do you know, that the female sea turtles swims hundreds of miles back to the beach, where they were born..? <br>
                That there are only seven kinds of sea turtles left and they are all endangered...? That 'ghost nets' are causing 
                many injuries or even death for a lot of sea turtles..?<br>
                To help the sea turtles, we need to stop to polute the oceans.

            <h2>The Hatchlings</h2>
            <p>
                The most vulnerable moment in the life of a sea turtle, is also it's first. When the hatchlings leave the nest,
                they navigate to the sea by the reflecting lights on the water surface. Electric lights can irritate them,
                so that they get lost and die. As well they are an easy prey for all kinds of predators on the beach.
                Only a fraction of the hatchlings will survive their first years.

            <h2>Volunteer</h2>
            <p>
                Because of the vulnerability of the nests it is important to secure them. Therefore many organizations give
                you the opportunity to volunteer around the world. Nesting beaches are in the most beautyful places.<br>
                So if you plan to travel for a longer period, if it's after school, a sabatical or retirement, don't miss a
                few weeks volunteering one of the most fascinating animals in the world. The Sea Turtle.
